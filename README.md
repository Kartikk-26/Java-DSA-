# Everyday Learning Series: Java + DSA

👋 **Welcome to my "Everyday Learning Series" repository!**  
This repository documents my journey of mastering Java and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) through consistent daily practice and learning.

## 📚 About the Project
This repository serves as a journal of my daily coding exercises, challenges, and concepts learned in Java and DSA. My primary goals are to enhance my problem-solving skills, deepen my understanding of Java, and explore various data structures and algorithms.

## ✨ What to Expect
- **Daily Commits** : I commit code daily, showcasing my progress in learning Java and DSA. Expect new code, solutions, and concept explanations regularly. 📅

- **Code & Concepts** : This repository includes code snippets, implementations of various data structures, and algorithm explanations. Each commit features a brief description of the day's work. 💻

- **Learning Milestones** : I will track my progress by noting milestones, such as completing specific topics or mastering challenging concepts. 🎯

## 🚀 How to Use
Feel free to explore, fork, or clone the repository to your local machine. You can use the code as a reference, study the implementations, and follow my daily progress.

### Cloning the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kartikk-26/Java-DSA-.git
```

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Java** : The primary programming language used for coding exercises and implementations.
- **Data Structures & Algorithms** : Topics covered include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, sorting, searching, and more.
